            This is a Directory of people of knowledge where you can find their Biographies, Teachers, Universities
            studied under, their Ijazat, and Tazkiayaat, and a lot more.
          </p>

            Our aim is to have a central hub to help get to know the muslim scholars and students of knowledge. This
            will make it easy to find people of knowledge and know their credentials etc.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We did not find any such source where we could find infomation about Scholars and Students of knowledge
            henc
            hence this idea was born.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            You can search by name or University or books and you will find everything linked together to have a
            clearer
            picture and leave with the most information.
